# A quick little script used for grading students when I download their stuff.
# Argument: last name of student (assuming a tarball is in the current directory)
# WhatDo:
#   1) makes a directory of that name
#   2) moves tarball to said directory
#   3) untars the files right there
#   4) moves a grading rubric into the directory
#   5) specializes the name of the grading ruberic
#   6) opens the rubric.
